                                        In your Social Service you have to keep a portfolio, through which you and I (and your colleagues and peers) will keep record of your service to society. This portfolio is meant to help you enhance, strengthen and reflect upon your teaching practice. The combination of all the subjects in this BA, both theoretical and practical, your general knowledge, values and own personality will be now used and shared (if wanted) with others.

                                We believe that reflective practice can be a beneficial process in your teacher professional development, both now, as a pre-service teacher, and later on as an in-service teacher. What does reflective practice involve? Let’s see what some authors say about it. Donald Schon (1987) introduced the concept of reflective practice as a critical process in refining one's artistry or craft in a specific discipline. He recommends reflective practice as a way for beginners in a discipline to recognize consonance between their own individual practices and those of successful practitioners. Reflective practice involves thoughtfully considering one's own experiences in applying knowledge to practice while being coached by professionals in the discipline (Schon, 1996).

                                As we said before, everything you have learnt in the BA and from other life experiences merges here. In Servicio Social you (the trainee) bring reports of your field experiences to your trainer(s) and both analyze your teaching strategies with your mentors, colleagues and students. This collaborative model of reflective practice enriches trainees' personal reflections on their work and provides trainees with suggestions from peers on how to refine their teaching practices (Syrjala, 1996). This also gives way to further research as the trainer can become researcher and the trainee his/her assistant. The teacher-educator as researcher and role model encourages students to put theories they have learnt into practice in their classrooms.

                                        As you have seen in Finding out about the Language Classroom, Teaching Practice, Second Language Acquisition, Teaching Language as a System, Teaching Language as Communication etc., action research is defined as a tool of curriculum development consisting of continuous feedback that targets specific problems in a particular school setting (Hopkins & Antes, 1990). As such, it has become a standard concept in teacher education programs.

This also gives way to further research as the trainer can become researcher and the trainee his/her assistant. The teacher-educator as researcher and role model encourages students to put theories they have learnt into practice in their classrooms.

            <p>
                Licklider (1997) found that self-directness (including self-learning from experience in natural settings) is an important component of adult learning. The primary benefit of reflective practice for pre and in-service teachers is a deeper understanding of their own teaching style and ultimately, greater effectiveness as a teacher. Other specific benefits noted in current literature include the validation of a teacher's ideals, beneficial challenges to tradition, the recognition of teaching as artistry, and respect for diversity in applying theory to classroom practice.
            </p>

            <p>
                Isn’t this what constructivism is about? Isn’t it all situated teaching and learning?: it is field-based, case-based, problem-based, task-based and place-based.

                <p>"The theory of situated cognition… claims that every human thought is adapted to the environment, that is, situated, because what people perceive, how they conceive of their activity, and what they physically do develop together"</p>
                <p class="cita mb-00">(Clancey, 1997, p. 1).</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Situated cognition is argued that it provides a broad, useful framework focusing on everyday cognition, authentic tasks, and the value of in-context apprenticeship training. But, how does this learning theory differ from behavioral or cognitive perspective of learning?
            </p>
            <p>
                Behaviorist theories and cognitive theories look at knowledge external to world, either in behaviors or internal processes or structures. On the contrary, situated learning looks at the learning phenomenon in a broader and holistic perspective incorporating behaviors (actions) and cognition by recognizing the interaction between people and environment and the role of situation. Wilson and Myers (2000) commented that situated learning "is positioned to bring the individual and the social together in a coherent theoretical perspective.”
